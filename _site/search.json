    "text": "Dear Chubbu!\nYesterday you came up to me in the morning and stood there in a “significant” way, like you used to as small child and were waiting for my response to a particularly clever answer you had just given.\nI…was preoccupied. There was Paati, your grandmother who needed surgery very quickly. I was moving her to the larger Guest Bedroom, closer to the door and in the quietest part of the house. And there was furniture to move and her clothes….so, just heard you say you had made it to the Prague Film School and here I was too frazzled to listen. And I probably made it worse by asking you to help me shift the furniture and snapping at you too, when I could not get you to do exactly what I wanted you to do.\nThere is nothing left to say…except that I really should have paid more attention to you. And I still can’t believe it that you are going further away in a short while.\nThat night you were excited enough to get your friend Srinidhi to get started with her application process. You both worked late into the night, preparing applications, SOPs and other documents. In the morning I could see the tell-tale “shoemaker and the elves” signs of midnight food-making in the kitchen !!\nSigns of Dreams."
